This is a project made to convert the standard Seismograph to a digital one , saves paper XD

this project uses an arduino uno and a MPU6050 gyroscope accelerometer module

the module is connected to the arduino in the following way:

MPU6050 | ARDUINO
vcc     | 5v
GND     | GND
SCL     | A4
SDA     | A5
ADO     | GND

If the acceleration in the gyroscope is greater than 15 m/s^2 then it records the next 500 acceleration points in the x and y axis each with 
a gap of 0.050s 

acceleration is sent to ethe laptop through the serial bus which is recieved by the python program 

the acceleration is converted to Displacement and is plotted with matplotlib , it is a live graph

there will be a delay in the real time graph plotting due to the limitations of USB
